# Visualize Keycloak

## Development
At the moment this project doesn't any templating feature of `Jekyll`; so you can use any http host tool to serve these files. (see: [npm: serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

If you prefer to use the templating feature you can start the docker container by running:
```
docker compose -f compose.yml up
```
